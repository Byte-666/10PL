# 10PL
10 papers that all PhD students in programming languages ought to know, for some value of 10

What
----

Programming language researchers investigate the analysis, design,
implementation, and evaluation of programming languages. Our goal 
is that the papers come from all of these areas. 

Why
---

A paper makes it on this list if one of us proposes the paper and none of
the others disagrees.

A paper may make it on the list if it is a milestone in the intellectual
history of programming languages. 

A paper may make it on the list if it covers an area particularly well. 

A paper may make it on the list if a PhD student in PL should know about
this topic---even if it is outside of the confines of PL.
